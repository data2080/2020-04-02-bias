# Types of auditing
- COMPAS: journalists gathered data related to where the tool was used including the system outputs, but not data like what when into the algorithm
- Gendershades: collected their own data they expected would be different from the training data, but similar enough to be a potential use case. They fed their data through the tools and provided a comparative audit of mulitple products to claim disparity in a type of technology
- Obermeyer: in collaboration with a hospital using the tool, they gathered real data and in collaboration with those that built the system were able to identify what the bigger problem was
- Amazon: detected the problem in quality control prior to deployment
